    content: "Makers/companies spend an enormous amount of time/efforts to raise attention from early adopters because their word of mouth impact is exceptionally high.

  ideahunt:
    sub_title: "Powerful Product Geeks Now in Crowdfunding Market"
    content: "The biggest problem for makers when crowdfunding is that it is very difficult to target the right people. Many makers on crowdfunding platforms need to heavily advertise their products on other media channels too. Ideahunt, backed by the product enthusiasts from Steemhunt, can provide a hassle-free and perfectly target-centered crowdfunding platform. The hunters will constantly look for innovative products to purchase with their HUNT tokens earned from Steemhunt/Reviewhunt. This means that makers will be free from advertising pressures."
  token_economy:
    sub_title: "Tokens that Create an Interchaneable Ecosystem between Makers and Early-adopters"

  token_distribution:
    sub_title: "No Crowd Sale, 50% Airdrop
to Focus on Product/Community Building"
    content: "The most important KSF (Key Successful Factor) of the HUNT platform is to gather as many product influencers as possible and amplify our community activities, rather than raising funds via crowd sales. So, we don’t run any public token sales. Instead, 50% of the tokens are airdropped for our target users so that the HUNT platform can invite many product influencers."
  whitepaper:
    sub_title: "We DON’T have time to Create
99% fiction paper."
    content: "Creating an eye-catching and highly detailed whitepaper becomes one of the most important parts for many blockchain projects. As well as platform coins, many decentralised applications are writing gazilion-page-long whitepapers - most of the contents are fiction and nobody bothers to finish reading it.
HUNT platform is simple to understand, it’s a Steem dApp so there’s no need to explain the blockchain technology. Also, this is a community-oriented project, so the value of the token is highly linked to the community value. Thus, we have no reasons to create a complicated fiction paper, instead we should focus on building this community platform."
