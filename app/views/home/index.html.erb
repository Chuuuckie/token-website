      The most important KSF (Key Successful Factor) of the HUNT platform is to gather as many product influencers as possible and amplify our community activities, rather than raising funds via crowd sales.

    <p class="grey-color">
      Creating an eye-catching and highly detailed whitepaper becomes one of the most important parts for many blockchain projects. As well as platform coins, many decentralised applications are writing gazilion-page-long whitepapers - most of the contents are fiction and nobody bothers to finish reading it.
      HUNT platform is simple to understand, it’s a Steem dApp so there’s no need to explain the blockchain technology. Also, this is a community-oriented project, so the value of the token is highly linked to the community value. Thus, we have no reasons to create a complicated fiction paper, instead we should focus on building this community platform.
